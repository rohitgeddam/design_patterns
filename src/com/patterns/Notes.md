# OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

# OO principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- favour composition over inheritance
- program to interface not implementation
- strive for looselycoupled designs between objects that interact
- classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

# OO patterns
- Strategy 
    - 
- Observer
    - defines a on-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- Decorator
    - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
